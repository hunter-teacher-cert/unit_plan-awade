# Intro to Game Design with Python
by Alicia Wade

-----

### General Overview
Intro to Game Design with Python is a fun engaging Unit that will be introduced to students after they have completed the AP CSP exam. With about a month of class left in the school year, students will engage in a series of lessons that will build on the skills that they already know and learn to program with python to build a series of interactive games that can range from simple one-button games to more complex strategy ones. This Unit will take students from a mostly block-based programming language to a text based object orientated language.

### Motivation for Unit
<p>Python is higly versatile programming language. It can be used to create both small and complex programs across all types of industries. It is one of the fastest growing, in demand programming languages. After the CSP AP exams, students are looking to decompress and are looking for fun engaging assignments. This Unit will comprise of some mini python games that will not only introduce students to python as an oject oriented programming language, but will also take some skills that they have already learnt and extend that into creating fun interactive games.</p>

### NY State Standards 
<!--The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation) -->
 * 9-12.CT.1 - Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.
 * 9-12.CT.2 - Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
 *  9-12.CT.3 - Refine and visualize complex data sets showing how to tell different stories with the same data set.
 *  9-12.CT.4 - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
  * 9-12.CT.5 - Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the        overall program.
  * 9-12.CT.6 - Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.
 *  9-12.CT.7 - Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.
 *  9-12.CT.8 - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.
 *  9-12.CT.9 - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
