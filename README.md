### Motivation for Unit
Python is higly versatile programming language. It can be used to create both small and complex programs across all types of industries. It is one of the fastest growing, in demand programming languages. After the CSP AP exams, students are

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)
 * 9-12.CT.1 - Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.
 * 9-12.CT.2 - Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
 *  9-12.CT.3 - Refine and visualize complex data sets showing how to tell different stories with the same data set.
 *  9-12.CT.4 - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
  * 9-12.CT.5 - Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the        overall program.
  * 9-12.CT.6 - Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.
 *  9-12.CT.7 - Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.
 *  9-12.CT.8 - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.
 *  9-12.CT.9 - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
